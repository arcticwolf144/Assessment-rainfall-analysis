# Assessment-rainfall-analysis
This data looks at the average rainfall patterns in Oxford and Melbourne. 
Necessary R scripts are included in the "src" folder. The "1.combine_data" script should be run first, and this will generate the average_rainfall data table
which is stored in the "data" folder along with the raw data for each location. 
The "2. make_plot" script can then be run to generate the plot located in the "out" folder.
